title : Entropy production of scalar Langevin systems 
---

Motivated by the distinct non-equilibrium nature of active systems, we introduce the entropy production rate (EPR) as a quantitative measure of time reversal symmetry breaking. It can be defined either at particle level or at the level of coarse-grained fields such as den- sity; the EPR for the latter quantifies the extent to which these coarse-grained fields behave irreversibly. In this work, we first develop a general method to compute the EPR of scalar Langevin field theories with additive noise (this large class includes the aforementioned Model AB). Treating the scalar field Ï† as the sole observable, we arrive at an expression for the EPR that is non-negative for every field configuration and is quadratic in the time-antisymmetric component of the dynamics. Our general expression is a function of the quasipotential, which determines the full probability distribution for configurations, and is not generally calculable. To alleviate this difficulty, we present a small-noise expansion of the EPR, which only re- quires knowledge of the deterministic (mean-field) solution for the scalar field in steady state, which generally is calculable, at least numerically. We demonstrate this calculation for the case of Model AB. We then present a similar EPR calculation for Model AB with the con- servative and non-conservative contributions viewed as separately observable quantities. The results are qualitatively different, confirming that the field-level EPR depends on the choice of coarse-grained information retained within the dynamical description.
