title : Active matter in general 
---

I gave a talk on Active Matter at the Trinity Mathematics Society symposium a couple of months back. It's meant to be a popular science type introduction for Maths undergrads.

The slides are made with reveal.js and most of the pictures and videos are taken from seminal papers in the field.
